# SortManager

## Intorduction
This aim of this project was to demonstrate various techniques and methodoliges learned at Sparta Global thus far by creating various number sorting algorithms in Java. These were:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Binary Search Tree

## Bubble Sort
This is a comparitive sort algorithm which compares integers with their adjacent neighbours and makes swaps if they are not in order. These passes are done continuously until the last integer in the list/array is checked. 

This was done iteratively in this particular Sort Manager project.

## Merge Sort
The merge sort is also a comparitive sort algorithm, which implements a 'divide and conquer' approach. The sorting process involves splitting the original unsorted array into individual 1x1 arrays, then proceeding to compare each element as the array is reconstructed in the same manner it was split. 

## Binary Tree
The binary tree has some key constraints which must be followed:
  - There must be no duplicate values
  - Each node can have a maximum of two child nodes
  - The left child node is for numbers smaller than the parent
  - The right child node is for numbers larger than the parent

The Binary Tree implementation in this project allows the user to add integers (multiple or an array of multiple), query integers in the tree, get left and right children (if they exist) and return the tree as a sorted array.
